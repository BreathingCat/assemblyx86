README

created by @DispleasedOwl on Github

The main goal of this exercise was to create a game in which a car, which the user controls, must not collide or exit the main road.
More features were added to the final exercise, tho. The more laps the car completes (since the left and rights turns are predefined), 
the faster the car will go, and the user will receive a trophy. A max of trophies was not added, since i couldnt get to the max :D
